    <div class="desc"><h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Another of my most favorite Korean dishes. Very mild and perfect for eating any time of the day, also good for trips as it's compact and not too saucy or fragile.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Sesame oil</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Vinegar (White or apple)</li>
      <li>Mayonaise</li>
      <li>250g Sushi rice</li>
      <li>1 Danmuji (yellow pickled radish)</li>
      <li>1 package Gim (seaweed paper), toasted</li>

      <li>1 Cucumber</li>
      <li>2-3 Carrots</li>
      <li>3-4 Eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <h3>Prepare the rice</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Put the freshly made steamy rice into a large bowl. Add salt and vinegar and gently fold it in with a rice scoop or a wooden spoon. Set aside and let the rice cool down.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Prepare the tuna</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Drain tuna and mix in bowl with mayonaise until it becomes a smooth paste.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Prepare the egg</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Whisk 3-4 eggs in a cup.</li>
        <li>Oil pan and fry in pan and once it sets, flip it over to the other side.</li>
        <li>Put on cutting board and cut into thin stripes.</li>
        <li>Set aside on kitchen towel do let the oil dry off.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Prepare the carrots</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Peel carrots and cut into thin stripes.</li>
        <li>Fry with oil until golden.</li>
        <li>Set aside on kitchen towel do let the oil dry off.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Prepare the cucumber</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Cut cucumber into small stripes and salt</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Prepare the danmuji (yellow pickled radish) </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Put the danmuji on the cutting board and cut thin stripes.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Roll the gimbap</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place a sheet of gim on a gimbal (a bamboo mat for making gimbap), or simply on a cutting board, with the shiny side down.</li>
        <li>Wet your hands a bit and evenly spread rice over the gim, thin but so that the rice completely covers the gim, leaving ~10 cm margin uncovered along the top edge. If the rice sticks to the hands to much, re-wet hands.</li>
        <li>Put carrot, egg, cucumber and danmuji in the bottom part (maybe 2/4 part) and leave space of ~3cm between the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Put a decent amount of tuna in between the ingredients you laid out before.</li>
        <li>Use both hands to pick up the bottom edge of the mat and use it to roll the gim up and over the fillings so the rice surrounds them. Squeeze the mat gently and then continue rolling up the gim in the mat, squeezing the mat regularly to get a tight roll. Unroll the mat and remove the roll from the mat. Set the roll aside, with the seam down. Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make more rolls. Stick some rice corns to the last part of the gim inside, to ensure it will stick to the gim when closed.</li>
        <li>Put a bit of sesame oil in your hands or use a brush and cover the rolls with sesame.</li>
        <li>Cut each roll into small slices with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li>For easier slicing, wipe your knife with a wet paper towel (or kitchen cloth) as you go.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Serve</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Arrange the slices on a plate or pack in a lunchbox. The gimbap will keep for several hours at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Can be stored in the fridge, but tastes better fresh.</li>
      </ol>
