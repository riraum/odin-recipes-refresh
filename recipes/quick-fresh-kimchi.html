    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>Most important Korean side dish. Best if home made and not mass produced overseas, at least if you're a Kimchi connoisseur like me. Again a queen Maangchi recipe from <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/baechu-geotjeori" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound napa cabbage (baechu) leaves, core removed</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons fermented salty anchovies (myeolchi-jeot) with their liquid</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons glutinous rice flour (or rice flour, or all purpose flour)</li>
      <li>1½ teaspoons sugar</li>
      <li>⅓ cup Korean hot pepper flakes (gochugaru)</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
      <li>3 garlic cloves</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ginger</li>
      <li>¼ cup onion</li>
      <li>2 green onions, sliced diagonally</li>
      <li>½ cup Asian chives (buchu), cut into 1 inch long</li>
      <li>¼ cup carrot matchsticks</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut cabbage leaves lengthwise once or twice into strips about 1 inch wide. Cut each strip diagonally once or twice and put them into a large bowl.</li>
      <li>Add ½ cup water and sprinkle the salt over top. Toss the cabbage well with your hands to spread the salt evenly on the leaves.</li>
      <li>Salt for 30 minutes, tossing every 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>While it’s salting, make kimchi paste:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small saucepan add fermented salty anchovies, ½ cup water, and glutinous rice flour. Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon.</li>
      <li>Heat it over medium heat, stirring occasionally for about 4 to 5 minutes until all the fish is melted. Strain the mixture to a large bowl. Discard the fish bones in the strainer. Let the mixture cool down.
</li>
<li>Add hot pepper flakes and sugar. Mix it well with a wooden spoon.
</li>
<li>Add garlic, ginger, and onion to a food processor and grind it all for 1 minute until smooth. Add it to the hot pepper mixture and stir well.
</li>
<li>Add green onion, chives, and carrot and stir well.
</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Make kimchi:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Rinse the cabbage in cold water, changing the water a couple of times until the cabbage is very clean.
</li>
<li>Drain the cabbage well and add it to the kimchi paste. Wear your kitchen gloves and mix everything well.
</li>
<li>Sprinkle the sesame seeds, and transfer to a plate and serve right away as a side dish for rice, kalguksu (knife-cut noodle soup), or porridge.</li>
    </ol>
