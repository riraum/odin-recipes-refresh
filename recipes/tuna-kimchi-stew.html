    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>One of my most favorite Korean dishes. Best made with self-made Kimchi, very much a comfort food for me. Usually quite spicy but not as extreme as other Korean dishes</p>

    <p>Credits to Maangchi, for the following recipe that we can use. Visit her site and see the recipe on the original site <a href="https://www.maangchi.com/recipe/chamchi-kimchi-jjigae" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> She is the reference for authentic Korean recipes in English.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 or 2 cans of tuna</li>
      <li>1 pound fermented kimchi, cut into 2 inch long pieces</li>
      <li>¼ cup kimchi brine, optional</li>
      <li>1 medium onion (about 1 cup), sliced</li>
      <li>2 green onion, one cut diagonally into pieces and one chopped up into small pieces</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Korean hot pepper flakes</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons Turbinado sugar (or white or brown sugar)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>8 ounces tofu (about 1 cup), sliced into bite size pieces</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Place the kimchi in a shallow, heavy pot or pan. Add kimchi brine, onion, green onion, kosher salt, hot pepper flakes, sugar, and toasted sesame oil. Add 2½ cups water and cover. Cook for 25 minutes over medium high heat. If it boils over, crack the lid a little and if the water boils out, add more so that the kimchi and all the ingredients are always submerged.</li>
      <li>Stir the stew with a wooden spoon and add tuna and tofu. Continue to cook for another 5 minutes until the tofu turns soft.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle with the chopped green onion and serve right away with rice and more side dishes if you desire.</li>
    </ol>
